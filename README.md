# SBD_PolyphaseSort
This is a project for Data Base Structure subject for my study in Gdansk University of Technology. In this project I implemented algorythm that can sort data from hard disk without loading the whole data at the same time to RAM. This algorythm uses only few megabytes RAM (no matter how big is file it is sorting) and can sort files that are larger in size than RAM itself.
